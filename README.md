# Overview

This software was built to learn how to implement the use of a Cloud Database. 

I wrote a program that keeps track of a catalogue of items from the cloud. You can add, modify, and delete data.

# Cloud Database

I am using Google Firebase, and it's realtime database.

The structure of the database lets a user make new file paths, and modify all data related to it.

# Development Environment

I used Python in Visual Studio Code, with the firebase_admin module.

# Useful Website

- [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

# Future Work

- Implement more structure into how data is handled, I.E. Implement better ways to navigate, and handle data structure.
- Create a system that implements the ability to handle inventory numbers.
